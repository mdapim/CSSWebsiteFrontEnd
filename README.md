## Description
Here we’ve developed a website for a project in order to utilise the skills we've gained during Sigma Labs Fullstack engineering course.
The initial idea was to create a website that provided a tool a CSS specificity tool which developers could use to calculate the weight of the CSS stylings written, this can in turn help debug or shape the way they use their stylings. 
<br />
<br />
<hr />
This idea later developed into a website aimed at developing a community that is able to contribute to the website directly and learn not only providing a tool but a hub to communicate. We’ve done the following to achieve this:
- A forum page, categorized by questions, demonstration of work, discussions and ideas for the website
- Login functionality to allow users to leave/write comments and submit suggestions.
- A guides section where selected content from an admin is available and accessible. 
- Introduce a new tool that allows further insight into the styling and design content of a website, the CSS specificity tool
